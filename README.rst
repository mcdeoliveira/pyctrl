**Release 0.3**

This is a Python library for system and control.

We only support Python 3, and are not interested in Python 2 at all.

you will also need to install the rcpy package
(`github <https://github.com/mcdeoliveira/rcpy>`__,
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=rcpy>`__).
