pyctrl: a Python Suite for Systems and Control
==============================================

**Release 0.4**

This is a Python library for system and control.

We only support Python 3, and are not interested in Python 2 at all.

Preliminaries
-------------

You will need to have python3, pip3 and numpy installed. On a Debian
based OS (including the Beaglebone Black and Blue) type:

::

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-numpy python3-scipy

Starting with version 0.4 there is a web server based on the flask
microframework. Install flask:

::

    sudo pip3 install flask
	
if you would like to use this feature.

In order to use this package with the Robotics Cape or the Beaglebone
Blue you will also need to install the rcpy package (`github
<https://github.com/mcdeoliveira/rcpy>`__, `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=rcpy>`__).

Installation
